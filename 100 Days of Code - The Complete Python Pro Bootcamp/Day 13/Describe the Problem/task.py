my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# It will print it when i = 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#  when i = 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# it only includes values from 1 to 19 and doesn't include 20
